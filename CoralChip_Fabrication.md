## Solid Works Design
- Using Solid Works, a 40 x 3 x .1 mm channel is created. 
- The channel is built inside a 50 x 13 x 5 mm rectangular chamber.
Save file as STL.

## Mold Printing
- The SW STL design was printed using an Ultimaker with a 0.4 nozzle tip at 10-15% fill.


## PDMS Prep
-  PDMS base and curing agents were used in a 10:1 ratio. 
10 parts base and 1 part curing agent.
- 30 ml of base was first added to a 50 ml conical tube, followed by 3 ml of curing agent.
- The mixture was the held to vortex for 15 min to insure complete mixing.
- The conical tube was then placed in a centrifuge for 30 min at 3000 rpm and 4 degrees Celsius to remove all bubbles from the mixture. This step is vital.
- Before pouring mixture into mold, wipe down with ethanol to remove any impurities.
- Next place the mold into the vacuum pot and slowly pour the mixture into the mold. Holding the conical tube as close to the base of the mold as possible and slowly pouring helps to prevent the emergence of new bubbles.
- Close vacuum pot lid and turn on vacuum pump.

## Vacuum Procedure:
- The mold should be left in the pump for a total of 48 hours.
- During the first hour, every 10 minutes the hose connecting the vacuum to the pump should be forcefully removed. This will force any bubbles to the surface and pop them due to the sudden change in air pressure.
- After 48 hours remove the mold.

## Chip Prep:
- The chip should now be slowly removed from the mold. Make sure to slowly peel as to not damage the channel.
- Using a 1.5 ml biopsy punch, punch one hole at each end of the channel and using a 3 ml biopsy bunch, punch one whole at the center. 
- Finally, using a polymer glue, bond the chip to a glass slide by gluing across the edges. This ensures that the channel does not become clogged.
