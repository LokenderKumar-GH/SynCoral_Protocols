	- with 3% [Antibiotics-antimycotics solution Thermofisher #1524006](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15240062#/15240062) solution.  

**6.2** <a name="Trypsin"></a> **Trypsin**    
- **6.2.1**. Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a conical tube (15 mL) and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  
	- NOTE: A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
- **6.2.2** Aspirate the supernatant  and add 2 mL of [Trypsin fishersci #25300054](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/trypsin-05-edta/25300054) to resuspend the pellet.
  - NOTE: for different trypsin concentrations: 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no [HEPES Thermofisher #15630106](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/mammalian-cell-culture/reagents/hepes.html)) to make 0.125% trypsin solution. 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no [HEPES Thermofisher #15630106](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/mammalian-cell-culture/reagents/hepes.html)) to make 0.025% trypsin solution.
- **6.2.3** Incubate the resuspended cell mixture for 5 minutes at 25°C then check for cell separation (e.g. primarily individual cells in suspension, little to no large cell aggregates).  If not completely digested, incubate for another 5 minutes.
- **6.2.4** Add 3 mL of coral cell media to neutralize trypsin then centrifuge cells at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.
- **6.2.5** Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL of coral cell culture media.

- **6.3.2** Aspirate the supernatant  and add 2 mL of [Liberase solution Millipore Sigma #5401119001](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/roche/libtmro?lang=en&region=US&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpNr4BRDYARIsAADIx9zfc5YGD6_945gvdyfUuAw24tSf-Xyaf-Xb_pm_QNG67XttLhyo7hMaAtpPEALw_wcB) to resuspend the pellet.
  - NOTE: Liberase TM 2 x 5 mg (Millipore Sigma cat. no. 5401119001) – contains a blend of Collagenase I and Collagenase II and medium concentration of Thermolysin, a non-clostridial neutral protease. Reconstitute lyophilized enzyme (5mg) in 2 mL filtered artificial seawater to produce working solution **with concentration of 2.5 mg/mL liberase.**
  - NOTE: Liberase TM was selected versus Liberase DL because observation of tissue balls was not reported, suggesting cells remained dispersed after dissociation.
- **6.3.3** Incubate the resuspended cell mixture for **3 days at 25°C** then check for cell separation.
- **6.3.4** Add 3 mL of coral cell media to neutralize liberase then centrifuge cells at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.

9. Transfer 100 uL of the cell suspension to an Eppendorf tube and add 10 uL of trypan blue stain.  Mix the cell suspension with the dye.
  -   a. NOTE: Trypan blue is a mutagen – handle with care and dispose contaminated items in biohazard waste!  
10. Transfer 10 uL of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count the number of algae cells and coral cells noting the number of each cell type that stain blue.  
11. Count at least three 1 mm x 1 mm squares per hemocytometer side to obtain six measurements in one experiment.  
12. Report the following data:  

| Cell type | Total count | Dead count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Algae |   |     |
| Coral |   |     |

13. Calculate the cell solution concentration. C = c/d/A*f
  - C = concentration (cells/mL)
  - c = average number of cells counted (cells)
  - d = depth of hemocytometer chamber (0.1 mm)
  - A = area of hemocytometer counted (mm^2)
  - f = conversion factor (1000 mm^3/mL)
14. Securely cap Eppendorf tube and dispose of trypan blue dyed cell suspension into biohazard waste.
