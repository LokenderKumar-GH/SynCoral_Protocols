**C.** <a name="Isolation"></a> **Isolation**

1. Disinfect scissors with 70% ethanol.
2. Remove coral fragment from tank and place in glass crystallizing dish.
3. Cut coral nubbin (0.3-0.5 cm long) from fragment using sterilized clippers.
4. Bring nubbin into the biosafety cabinet and rinse nubbin 3 times with sterile filtered artificial seawater.
5. Place nubbin in sterile plastic petri dish containing sterile filtered calcium-magnesium free artificial seawater.

**6.1** <a name="Antibiotic-Antimycotic"></a> **Antibiotic-Antimycotic**   
- unsure of diffreence between this step and step 5.4.1  
	- with 3% [Antibiotics-antimycotics solution Thermofisher #1524006](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15240062#/15240062) solution.  

**6.2** <a name="Trypsin"></a> **Trypsin**    
- **6.2.1**. Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a conical tube (15 mL) and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  
	- NOTE: A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
- **6.2.2** Aspirate the supernatant  and add 2 mL of [Trypsin fishersci #25300054](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/trypsin-05-edta/25300054) to resuspend the pellet.
  - NOTE: for different trypsin concentrations: 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no [HEPES Thermofisher #15630106](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/mammalian-cell-culture/reagents/hepes.html)) to make 0.125% trypsin solution. 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no [HEPES Thermofisher #15630106](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/mammalian-cell-culture/reagents/hepes.html)) to make 0.025% trypsin solution.
	- NOTE: Both [trypsin] work and we need to measure the cell concentrations harvested resulting from the different concentrations.
- **6.2.3** Incubate the resuspended cell mixture for 5 minutes at 25°C then check for cell separation (e.g. primarily individual cells in suspension, little to no large cell aggregates).  If not completely digested, incubate for another 5 minutes.
- **6.2.4** Add 3 mL of coral cell media to neutralize trypsin then centrifuge cells at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.
- **6.2.5** Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL of coral cell culture media.  
	- NOTE: Lewinski lab coral culture media recipe here: [**Coral-Culture-Media-Reagents**](#Coral-Culture-Media-Reagents)

**6.3** <a name="Liberase"></a> **Liberase**   
- **6.3.1** Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a conical tube (15 mL) and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
- **6.3.2** Aspirate the supernatant  and add 2 mL of [Liberase solution Millipore Sigma #5401119001](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/roche/libtmro?lang=en&region=US&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpNr4BRDYARIsAADIx9zfc5YGD6_945gvdyfUuAw24tSf-Xyaf-Xb_pm_QNG67XttLhyo7hMaAtpPEALw_wcB) to resuspend the pellet.
  - NOTE: Liberase TM 2 x 5 mg (Millipore Sigma cat. no. 5401119001) – contains a blend of Collagenase I and Collagenase II and medium concentration of Thermolysin, a non-clostridial neutral protease. Reconstitute lyophilized enzyme (5mg) in 2 mL filtered artificial seawater to produce working solution **with concentration of 2.5 mg/mL liberase.**
  - NOTE: Liberase TM was selected versus Liberase DL because observation of tissue balls was not reported, suggesting cells remained dispersed after dissociation.
- **6.3.3** Incubate the resuspended cell mixture for **3 days at 25°C** then check for cell separation.
- **6.3.4** Add 3 mL of coral cell media to neutralize liberase then centrifuge cells at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.

**E.** <a name="Incubation-Conditions"></a> **Incubation-Conditions**  
- Temperature: 25C using a hotplate with a beaker of water  
  - NOTE: keep relative humidity above 50% but below 80%. Need to modify procedure to control RH in small plexiglass incubator
- Light levels: TBD (no initial differences observed with or without light)
	- NOTE: use [Aqua Illumination Prime 16HD light](https://www.aquaillumination.com/products/prime) and monitor conditions using [Neptune Systems New APEX Wi-Fi Controller System #NS1191](https://www.marinedepot.com/neptune-systems-new-apex-wi-fi-controller-system)

9. Transfer 100 uL of the cell suspension to an Eppendorf tube and add 10 uL of trypan blue stain.  Mix the cell suspension with the dye.
  -   a. NOTE: Trypan blue is a mutagen – handle with care and dispose contaminated items in biohazard waste!  
10. Transfer 10 uL of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count the number of algae cells and coral cells noting the number of each cell type that stain blue.  
11. Count at least three 1 mm x 1 mm squares per hemocytometer side to obtain six measurements in one experiment.  
12. Report the following data:  

| Cell type | Total count | Dead count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Algae |   |     |
| Coral |   |     |

13. Calculate the cell solution concentration. C = c/d/A*f
  - C = concentration (cells/mL)
  - c = average number of cells counted (cells)
  - d = depth of hemocytometer chamber (0.1 mm)
  - A = area of hemocytometer counted (mm^2)
  - f = conversion factor (1000 mm^3/mL)
14. Securely cap Eppendorf tube and dispose of trypan blue dyed cell suspension into biohazard waste.

**G.** <a name="General-Notes"></a> **General-Notes**
- When used 1 mL PenStrep, microorganism overgrowth observed on day 2 post-harvest.  
- When scraping off cells and can use original skeleton and place in media. sometimes has less gunk.
- NOTE: currently using cell viability (% alive & % dead) for protocol assessment. In the future we could incorporate metrics beyond cell viability (e.g. cell cycle, oxidative stress, DNA damage).
- other relevant Antibiotics: Gentamicin sulfate (Sigma, Cat# G1914), Neomycin sulfate (Sigma, Cat# PHR1491), Tobramycin sulfate (Sigma, Cat# T1783), Kanamycin sulfate (Sigma, Cat# 60615), Levofloxacin (Sigma, Cat# 28266-10G-F), Cefepime hydrochloride (Cat#PHR1763-1G, sigma).
