1. Disinfect scissors with 70% ethanol.
2. Remove coral fragment from tank and place in glass crystallizing dish.
3. Cut coral nubbin (0.3-0.5 cm long) from fragment using sterilized clippers.
4. Bring nubbin into the biosafety cabinet and rinse nubbin 3 times with sterile filtered artificial seawater.
5. Place nubbin in sterile plastic petri dish containing sterile filtered calcium-magnesium free artificial seawater.

D. <a name="Incubation"></a> **Incubation**  
6. Incubate nubbin or cells at 25°C for 3 hours in shaking incubator (rpm 30), in filtered, calcium and magnesium free, artificial seawater supplemented
 
6.1. <a name="Anti-Anti"></a> **Anti-Anti**   
 	- with 3% [antibiotics–antimycotics](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15240062#/15240062) solution.  
6.2. <a name="Trypsin"></a> **Trypsin**    
	- with X% [Trypsin](X) solution.  
6.3. <a name="Liberase"></a> **Liberase**   
	- with X% [Liberase](X) solution.  


7. Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a conical tube (15 mL) and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
8. Remove the supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL of coral cell culture media.

    -  culture conditions



E. <a name="Viability"></a> **Viability**  
9. Transfer 100 uL of the cell suspension to an Eppendorf tube and add 10 uL of trypan blue stain.  Mix the cell suspension with the dye.
    -   a. NOTE: Trypan blue is a mutagen – handle with care and dispose contaminated items in biohazard waste!
10. Transfer 10 uL of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count the number of algae cells and coral cells noting the number of each cell type that stain blue.
11. Count at least three 1 mm x 1 mm squares per hemocytometer side to obtain six measurements in one experiment.
12. Report the following data:

| Cell type | Total count | Dead count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Algae |   |     |
| Coral |   |     |

13. Calculate the cell solution concentration. C = c/d/A*f
  - C = concentration (cells/mL)
  - c = average number of cells counted (cells)
  - d = depth of hemocytometer chamber (0.1 mm)
  - A = area of hemocytometer counted (mm^2)
  - f = conversion factor (1000 mm^3/mL)
14. Securely cap Eppendorf tube and dispose of trypan blue dyed cell suspension into biohazard waste.
