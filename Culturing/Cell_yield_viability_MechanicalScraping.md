A. <a name="Materials"></a> **Materials**
      -   70% ethanol
      -   Scissors
      -   Medical grade toenail clippers
      -   Sterile filtered artificial seawater (regular and CaMg free)
      -   [Anti-Anti](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15240062#/15240062)
      -   Sterile plastic petri dish
      -   Scraper tool (surgical hook, sterile scalpel, toothbrush, paintbrush)
      -   Conical tube (15 mL)
      -   Centrifuge (can reach 1200 rpm)
      -   Pipette (P200, P20)
      -   Trypan blue stain
      -   Hemocytometer
      -   Eppendorf tube

B. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**

1. Disinfect scissors with 70% ethanol.
2. Remove coral fragment from tank and place in glass crystallizing dish.
3. Cut coral nubbin (0.3-0.5 cm long) from fragment using medical grade toenail clippers.
4. Bring nubbin into the biosafety cabinet and rinse nubbin 3 times with sterile filtered artificial seawater.
5. Place nubbin in sterile plastic petri dish containing sterile filtered calcium-magnesium free artificial seawater.
6. Mechanically scrape nubbin using a sterile scalpel or surgical hook.
    - a. NOTE: Need to try scraping polyps only first then coenosarc as a means of separating cell types.
    - b. NOTE: could also try toothbrush, paintbrush as scraper tool.
7. Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
8. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL of coral cell culture media.
    - Lewinski lab coral culture media includes: 15 mL DMEM, 10 mL FBS, [0.5 mL Anti-Anti](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15240062#/15240062), 0.5 mL Gentamicin, 74 mL artificial seawater.
    - NOTE: Filter all ingredients using a Corning vacuum filter/storage bottle system with 0.2 μm pore size membrane.
    - NOTE: When used 1 mL PenStrep, microorganism overgrowth observed on day 2 post-harvest.
9. Transfer 100 uL of the cell suspension to an Eppendorf tube and add 10 uL of trypan blue stain.  Mix the cell suspension with the dye.
  a. NOTE: Trypan blue is a mutagen – handle with care and dispose contaminated items in biohazard waste!
10. Transfer 10 uL of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count the number of algae cells and coral cells noting the number of each cell type that stain blue.
11. Count at least three 1 mm x 1 mm squares per hemocytometer side to obtain six measurements in one experiment.
12. Report the following data:
| Cell type | Total count | Dead count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Algae |   |     |
| Coral |   |     |

13. Calculate the cell solution concentration. C = c/d/A*f
  - C = concentration (cells/mL)
  - c = average number of cells counted (cells)
  - d = depth of hemocytometer chamber (0.1 mm)
  - A = area of hemocytometer counted (mm^2)
  - f = conversion factor (1000 mm^3/mL)
  NOTE: cell harvesting by calcium-magnesium free seawater induced tissue detachment [Domart-Coulon et al. 2011](https://www.pnas.org/content/98/21/11885.short) report a yield of 0.5-1 x 106 cells from a 0.3-0.5 mm long coral nubbin after 3 h incubation. NL lab replicated this method and was able to harvest 1.8 x 106 cells from a 0.7 mm long coral nubbin, which aligns with the previously reported findings.
14. Securely cap Eppendorf tube and dispose of trypan blue dyed cell suspension into biohazard waste.
