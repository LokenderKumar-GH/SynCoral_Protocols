A. <a name="Materials"></a> **Materials**
  - Percoll
  - Filtered artificial seawater
  - Refrigerator
  - 15 mL conical tubes
  - P1000 micropipette
  - Centrifuge with swing bucket rotor (needs to reach 1460 rpm)

B. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**
1. Prepare 100 (no mixing), 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5% Percoll solutions by mixing 100% Percoll with the appropriate volume of filtered artificial seawater in individual Eppendorf or 15 mL conical tubes.
2. Refrigerate each of the eleven solutions (5-100%) for at least 30 minutes before construction of the Percoll gradient.
3. In a 15 mL conical tube, add 1 mL per Percoll concentration starting with 100% and working towards 10%.
4. Using a P1000 micropipette, Add 2 mL of coral cell sample to the top of the Percoll gradient.
5. Centrifuge tube at 400g (1460 rpm for swing bucket rotor) for 10 minutes.
  - a. Expected result: sym-free cells isolated at the 20-30% interphase, gastrodermal cells containing Symbiodiniaceaea isolated at the 70-80% interphase.
  - b. NOTE: Cells separated but not into distinct bands.  Percoll layers appeared blended.  Need to confirm that the missing Ficoll 400 and PEG 8000 was the cause.
