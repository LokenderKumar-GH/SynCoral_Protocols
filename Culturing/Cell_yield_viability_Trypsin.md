    - Conical tube (?15 mL?)
    - Centrifuge (can reach 1200 rpm)

    - Hemocytometer
    - Eppendorf tube

B. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**

1. Disinfect scissors with 70% ethanol.
2. Remove coral fragment from tank and place in glass crystallizing dish.
3. Cut coral nubbin (0.3-0.5 cm long) from fragment using medical grade toenail clippers.
4. Bring nubbin into the biosafety cabinet and rinse nubbin 3 times with sterile filtered artificial seawater.
5. Place nubbin in sterile plastic petri dish containing sterile filtered calcium-magnesium free artificial seawater.
6. Either
  - a. Mechanically scrape nubbin using a sterile scalpel or surgical hook.
	- Or
  - b. Incubate nubbin at 25°C for 3 hours in shaking incubator (rpm 30), in filtered, calcium and magnesium free, artificial seawater supplemented with 3% antibiotics–antimycotics solution.
7. Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a conical tube (?SIZE?) and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
8. Aspirate the supernatant  and add 2 mL of trypsin to resuspend the pellet.
  - a. NOTE: trypsin solution: 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no HEPES) to make 0.125% trypsin solution. 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no HEPES) to make 0.025% trypsin solution.
9. Incubate the resuspended cell mixture for 5 minutes at 25°C then check for cell separation.  If not completely digested, incubate for another 5 minutes.
10. Add 3 mL of coral cell media to neutralize trypsin then centrifuge cells at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.
11. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL of coral cell culture media.
12. Transfer 100 uL of the cell suspension to an Eppendorf tube and add 10 uL of trypan blue stain.  Mix the cell suspension with the dye.
  - a. NOTE: Trypan blue is a mutagen – handle with care and dispose contaminated items in biohazard waste!
13. Transfer 10 uL of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count the number of algae cells and coral cells noting the number of each cell type that stain blue.
14. Count at least three 1 mm x 1 mm squares per hemocytometer side to obtain six measurements in one experiment.
15. Report the following data:

| Cell type | Total count | Dead count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Algae | --- | --- |
| Coral | --- | --- |

16. Calculate the cell solution concentration. C = c/d/A*f
  - C = concentration (cells/mL)
  - c = average number of cells counted (cells)
  - d = depth of hemocytometer chamber (0.1 mm)
  - A = area of hemocytometer counted (mm^2)
  - f = conversion factor (1000 mm^3/mL)
17. Securely cap Eppendorf tube and dispose of trypan blue dyed cell suspension into biohazard waste.
